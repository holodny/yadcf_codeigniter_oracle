# yadcf_codeigniter_oracle
Datatables Reports for Codeigniter Framework and Oracle Using YADCF and Buttons Libraries

To use this project, add the models, views and controllers to a Codeigniter project.  
Create an Oracle schema called "scott" and run the attached SQL in it.

Although my project was aimed at Codeigniter and Oracle, the view is JQuery and is mostly framework, serverside language and database agnostic.

Set up your Codeigniter project to access that database.
